## About Treasure
The Treasure platform is your destination for gaming on Treasure. As an asset marketplace, a hub for game discovery and distribution, center for tournaments and events, and much more, Treasure brings together everything that players and game developers could possibly want under a single roof. 

## Local Setup
1. You need to obtain your own API key from Alchemy and use it in the `wallet.json` file. I'm using Alchemy but you can use other providers such as Ankr or Moralis.
